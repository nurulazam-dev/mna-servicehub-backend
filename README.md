# ⚙️ MNA ServiceHub Backend

> “All local services in one smart platform.”

**MNA ServiceHub** is a role-based service booking platform (Admin, Manager, Service Provider, Job Candidate, Customer) where customers can discover and request local services. Managers assign service providers to requests based on their schedules, service providers complete the assigned tasks, and the Admin oversees and controls the entire system.

MNA ServiceHub acts as a centralized digital platform that enables all local service-related activities to be managed efficiently from a single place.

# ⚠️ Critical Backend Guidelines

### ✅ Review Creation Flow

1. Validate ownership
2. Check:
   - status = COMPLETED
   - paymentStatus = PAID

3. Prevent duplicate review
4. Create review (transaction)
5. Recalculate ratings:
   - Service
   - Provider

---

### ✅ Rating Calculation Formula

```ts
averageRating = totalRatingSum / totalReviews;
```

---

### ❗ Important Constraints

- One request → one review (`@unique`)
- Provider must exist (non-null in completed request)
- Use transaction for consistency
